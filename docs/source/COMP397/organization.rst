In this course, we'll look at the foundations of research in computing, the motivations, the style, and the results. Doing so will allow us (and we mean it, us) to understand better and deeper what drives innovation in the discipline. How to tell a truly emerging trend from a passing infatuation. How to communicate an idea or an opinion about one. 

If you are taking this course to pursue a specific research topic or idea, please talk with your instructor sooner than later. Depending on your interests they may (or may not) be able to accommodate your plans. 

The course requires you to do a fair amount of reading and writing.  

#. Introductions. Foundations by Bush and von Neumann. A quick approach to critical reading of papers. Assignment: critical summaries of papers (200 words/paper/max) for non-technical audience, due in class. Require some formatting, maybe Google Docs.
