Grade scale and grading principle
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Grading measures (or should measure) learning. Often, we learn the subject of the course. And sometimes we learn that it is not our favorite subject, or that it was not the best time to study for it. The principle that guides my grading is simple: reward learning at any level, even if it leads to the realization that it was not the best time for someone to take this course. Based on this principle, I use the following grade scale:

* **A:** reflects mastery of more than 90% of the course's topics.
* **B:** reflects mastery of 80-90% of the course's topics.
* **C:** reflects mastery of 66-80% of the course's topics.
* **D:** recognizes earnest effort and participation in the course and it indicates that maybe it is not your time yet to master the subject.
* **F:** is given rarely to those who show no interest in the course. Students at risk of receiving an F will be notified prior to the drop/withdraw deadline for the term.
