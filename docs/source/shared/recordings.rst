Recordings 
----------

Zoom sessions are recorded and available to watch later if, for some serious reason you may not be able to attend a class meeting. **Notice that the availability of recordings is not a reason to skip class without a justifiable reason.** Zoom provides me with attendance information and I will be monitoring it closely. Some courses include in-class assessments as part of the grading scheme. I am planning to continue conducting these assessments even when meeting remotely, so your attendance is critical.   

Recordings are made available only to Loyola Students. You must contact me and provide a justification as to why you missed class if you wish access to a recorded meeting. Authentication (using your LUC login credentials) is required to access a recording. These recordings will be removed after the semester is over. Downloading of these recordings is not possible.
