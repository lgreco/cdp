Zoom
=====

If the class is asynchronous or online, you'll need a conferencing tool like Zoom or Teams video to connect with me. It is a good idea to have such a tool handy even for synchronous courses that meet on campus. For example, during inclement weather, I may move the class meeting to Zoom, to keep everyone safe, dry, and warm.

 You can also use Zoom to meet with me during Student Hours, if one of us is not on campus. In this case, an appointment is needed.

You need to `download and install Zoom <https://www.luc.edu/its/itrs/teachingwithtechnology/zoom/>`_ to your mobile device or laptop. Zoom is the University's preferred tool for videoconferencing.
