Assignments & Exams
====================

Course performance is evaluated with a series of assignments. Assignments are typically organized as homework, quizzes, and exams. In a 200-level course and higher, homeworks and exams are week-long, take-home assignments. Depending on the course, there are between 8 and 12 assignments per term.
