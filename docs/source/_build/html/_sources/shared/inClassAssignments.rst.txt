In-class assessments
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In-class assessments may be conducted in some of the courses that I teach. In this case, you will have 20-30 minutes to complete them at the end of class session. For consistency, **in-class assessments will be held midweek,** on Tuesday or Wednesday. Assessment performance will be tallied together with regular homework.
