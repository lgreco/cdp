Make-up assignments
====================

In 200-level and higher courses I do not offer make up assigmemnts. That's because of the *Ungrading* system I use in those courses, where students self-evaluate their performance.

Each regular assignment is basically a make-up assignment, allowing everyone the opportunity to improve their work one step at a time.
