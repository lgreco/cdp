Online meetings
================

If the class is asynchronous or online, you'll need [Microsoft Teams to participate](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software).

It is a good idea to have this app handy even for synchronous courses that meet on campus. For example, during inclement weather, I may move the class meeting to online, to keep everyone safe, dry, and warm.

 You can also use the meeting app to meet with me during Student Hours, if one of us is not on campus. In this case, an appointment is needed.
