Student hours (aka office hours)
================================

To give you more flexibility with your time, `I have made my schedule available on Calendly <https://calendly.com/leo_irakliotis/20min>`_. You can schedule an appointment with me by finding the best time slot that works for you. If there are no available time slots of if they conflict with your schedule, please notify me, suggest a couple of other time slots that will work for you, and I will do my best to find us time to meet.

Walk-ins are welcome but `appointments are highly recommended <https://calendly.com/leo_irakliotis/15min>`_. Students with an appointment take precedence. My office is in **Doyle 207**. For online meetings, I use Microsoft Teams.
