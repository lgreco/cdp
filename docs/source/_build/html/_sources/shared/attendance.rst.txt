Attendance policy
=================

Programming-intensive courses involve live coding, hands-on demonstration, and discussions. Therefore, **attendance is required.**

Everyone is expected to miss a class meeting now and then. Missing more than 10% of the class meetings in a term will have a serious impact on your final grade. Missing more, will have a detrimental impact. Coming to class 5 or more minutes late or leaving 5 or more minutes early counts as a missed class.

If you miss a class meeting it is your responsibility to recover notes and other information from your classmates. Student hours (aka office hours) are not a substitute for missed class meetings.

If you miss more than 1/4 of the class meetings, you final grade will be an F.

The university classifies certain absences as excused (see [Undergraduate Attendance Policy](https://catalog.luc.edu/academic-standards-regulations/undergraduate/)). These excused absences do not count as absences in the class.
