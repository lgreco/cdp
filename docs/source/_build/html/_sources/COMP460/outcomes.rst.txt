Course description and outcomes
********************************

This graduate course in algorithms reinforces and expands your understanding of algorithm design, analysis, and implementation. The course will provide a methodical framework to study algorithms -- from complexity notation to a taxonomy of algorithms. Against this backdrop, the course will then explore quantitative characteristics of classic and novel algorithms, and demonstrate proofs of correctness and completion. Finally the course will cover advanced algorithmic techniques, including probabilistic methods, statistical frameworks, parallelization, and numeric computations.

Using complexity notations and explore advanced paradigms like divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms. You will work with sophisticated data structures, tackle graph problems, and develop solutions for NP-complete challenges through approximation and heuristics. You will also engage with specialized topics such as string matching and computational geometry. Through practical projects, you will evaluate algorithm performance and gain insights into trade-offs in efficiency and resource use, preparing you to solve real-world computational problems critically and ethically.
