Shameless self-promotion
========================

I am a Chicago-based educator, researcher, and college manager. In 1999, I earned a PhD in Electrical [and Computer] Engineering from Colorado State University. My work was in optical information processing (optical computing, the unsung sibling of quantum computing). I've worked as a professor, dean, and provost prior to my teaching position at Loyola University Chicago. My funding record to date stands at $17m in grants and contracts. I am an expert in database design, competency-based education, and online learning modalities. 

At Loyola I teach a range of introductory and senior-level courses in computer science. I am also a faculty affiliate at the university's `Institute for Racial Justice <https://www.luc.edu/irj>`_.

As a consultant, I have worked with small and medium-size enterprises on technology and strategy. I have served as a consulting expert in intellectual property litigations, and as credentials expert on immigration cases.

In my free time, I am a photographer, diver, aviator, amateur radio operator, and the guardian of two dogs (Martin and Mina).

**A note for students:** My pop culture framework spans the 1980s and the 1990s. If you want to understand half the things I utter in class, watch a few episodes of the following: *Frazier, Star Trek the Next Generation, MASH,* and *Doctor Who.* I know who *Happy Potter* is. And there are three, and only three, *Star Wars* movies. Don't even try to debate otherwise with me. In terms of literature you should know who *Tom Bombadil* was. Seriously!
