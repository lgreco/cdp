Leo Irakliotis' Course Documentation Project
#############################################

This is a comprehensive site with material and information from the 
courses I teach. The documentation project is based on Restructured 
Text and `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_. Files are committed 
to a Github repository with native GitHub Actions that build the
gh-pages branch. That's the branch visible from the github.io pages
site.
