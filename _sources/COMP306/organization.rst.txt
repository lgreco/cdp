* Quantitative methods for data mining: qualitative and quantitative variables, samples and populations, descriptive statistics, central tendency, dispersion, bivariate data, probability, binomial distributions.
* Coding tools for data mining: from simple home-made programs to large, community-supported packages: Python and its Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn packages.
* Visualization concepts and styles.
* Simple visualization within Seaborn and matplotlib.
* Data curation and preparation.
* Data stores and warehouses.
* Association rules.
* Classification and clustering. 
* Rules, decision trees, Knn, K-means.
* Neural networks.

The central goal of this course is to impart basic skills in curating and analyzing large data sets from multiple sources. The course begins by developing models and mathematical tools necessary for the data analysis. Then it explores popular tools for manipulating and visualizing data. Finally, the course will explore standard and emerging methods for exploring data, including neural network classifications.
 
You must have access to a computer capable of accessing the web.
