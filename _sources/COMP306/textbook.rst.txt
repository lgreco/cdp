This course uses Python. In recent years, Python has emerged as the environment of choice for data analysis. That's because some of the most popular tools for data analysis are written in Python and are available as ready-to-use modules. These tools include *pandas, matplotlib,* and *seaborn.* Use of these tools is made even easier through web-based development tools. Google's Colab and Anaconda Navigator are two nicely supported environments for data analysis. For this course, Google Colab is preferred. If you have a Google account (e.g., a gmail address) you have access to Google Colab.
