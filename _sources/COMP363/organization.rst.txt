* Asymptotic notation, space and time complexity: why it matters?
* The source of all evil and good: recursion and its master theorem.
* Dynamic programming (i.e., recursion done right).
* Greedy algorithms.
* Trees and how to traverse, rotate, and rebalance them. And why bother?
* Graph algorithms (bomb your enemies' train tracks!)
* Stuff that can win you the *Turing Award:* NP-hardness

The central goal of this course is to impart basic skills in designing and implementing efficient and effective computer programs. The course begins by developing models and mathematical tools for measuring the efficiency of algorithms, followed by a variety of useful data structures and to algorithms for a variety of fundamental problems. Finally, the course will provide an introduction to classification of computational problems into different complexity classes. Actual programming will be interspersed with theoretical analysis, to demonstrate practical issues in the implementation of algorithmic solutions.

Designing *good* algorithms is central to software design. So, what makes an algorithm good? This goes beyond just arriving at the right answer, to arriving at this right answer efficiently. After all, you don't want to be staring at your computer all day just to get the sum of a dozen numbers. Efficiency is not just with respect to time, but also the resources required to solve the problem. Central to our discussion of algorithms will be the evaluation of solutions. Algorithms at its heart is problem solving. 

In this course we will focus on tapping into our creativity to identify possible solutions to a given problem. The course will blend application and theory. We will use a programming language (Python) to practice design and implementation of algorithms. 

You must have access to a computer (Mac, Windows, or
Ubuntu operating system), capable of accessing the web.
