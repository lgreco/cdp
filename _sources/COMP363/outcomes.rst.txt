In this course, you will deepen your understanding of algorithm design, analysis, and implementation. You will evaluate algorithm efficiency using complexity notations and explore advanced paradigms like divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms. You will work with sophisticated data structures, tackle graph problems, and develop solutions for NP-complete challenges through approximation and heuristics. You will also engage with specialized topics such as string matching and computational geometry. Through practical projects, you will evaluate algorithm performance and gain insights into trade-offs in efficiency and resource use, preparing you to solve real-world computational problems critically and ethically.



**Algorithm Analysis and Complexity:** Evaluate the time and space complexity of algorithms using Big-O, Big-Theta, and Big-Omega notations. Differentiate between worst-case, average-case, and best-case complexities and apply these analyses to problem-solving.

**Design and Implementation of Algorithms:** Apply algorithm design paradigms such as divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and backtracking to solve complex computational problems. Develop and implement efficient algorithms for fundamental problems in sorting, searching, graph traversal, and optimization.

**Advanced Problem Solving:** Solve problems using advanced data structures such as segment trees, Fenwick trees, suffix arrays, and disjoint-set unions. Design algorithms for NP-complete and NP-hard problems, leveraging approximation algorithms or heuristic methods where exact solutions are computationally infeasible.

**Graph Algorithms:** Analyze and implement algorithms for graph-related problems, including shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and maximum flow.

**String Processing and Computational Geometry:** Design and analyze algorithms for string matching and suffix array construction. Solve computational geometry problems involving convex hulls, line intersections, and Voronoi diagrams.

**Algorithmic Problem Formulation:** Translate real-world problems into algorithmic formulations, identify suitable algorithmic approaches, and justify the choice of data structures and methods.

**Empirical Performance Evaluation:** Compare algorithm performance empirically through programming projects, testing implementations on real datasets, and interpreting experimental results.

**Ethical and Practical Considerations:** Evaluate the trade-offs between algorithm efficiency, resource usage, and fairness in applications such as machine learning, encryption, and resource allocation.
