Checklist before starting the course
------------------------------------

This checklist comprises four sections: *Do, Know, Demonstrate,* and *Read.* It is important that you work through this checklist before the first class meeting.


Do
++

* Review the `course policies and expectations <https://lgreco.github.io/cdp/COMP271/introduction.html>`__.

 

* Write three items you found most challenging in COMP 170 (or equivalent introductory course you took to make it to COMP 271). These should be specific items (e..g., "It took me a while to understand constructors"). You will be asked to share these items with the rest of the class, during the first meeting.

* Write two items you found intuitive in COMP 170 (or any other introductory course you took to make it to COMP 271). These should be specific items (e..g., "Strings are awesome"). You will be asked to share these items with the rest of the class, during the first meeting.

* `Bookmark this site <https://lgreco.github.io/cdp/COMP271/introduction.html>`__.
  
* Download, install, and configure Microsoft Teams on your computer (if it is not already installed). Use your LUC UVID to log in to Teams. `Contacting me through Teams <https://teams.microsoft.com/l/chat/0/0?users=lirakliotis@luc.edu>`__ may be faster than email. 

* Optionally, `sign up for a GitHub account <https://github.com/>`__. It's free and it's cool. You can sign up for GitHub with your personal email address, i.e., an address you expect to use even after you graduate from LUC. Once you establish your GitHub account, you can always receive the student benefits the site offers, by adding your LUC email address to the account.


Know
++++

* How to access your computer's command line (the Terminal app in Apple, the Command app in Windows).

* How to use Microsoft Teams with your LUC UVID.
