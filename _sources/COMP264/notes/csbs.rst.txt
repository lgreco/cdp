Getting Started With *Code Step By Step*
---------------------------------------------------

*Code Step By Step* is a website to practice programming skills. We use it for assignments in COMP 170 and COMP 271. The following instructions walk you through setting up an account with Code Step By Step. Before you begin the registration process make sure that you have the following information:

* your official LUC email address; that's the email address ending in **@luc.edu;**
* the course number, semester, and the name of your instructor, e.g. *COMP 271, F21, Irakliotis.*

Part 1: Create your account 
======================================================================
(Skip to Part 2 if you already have an account with Code Step By Step)

Complete all the fields on the *Create An Account* page, using your **@luc.edu** email address. For *School/Org*, as soon as you start typing "Loyola ...", you will be given a few autocomplete choices in a pull down menu (3). Please make sure that you select "Loyola University Chicago". 

After you complete the registration process, you will receive an email to verify your account. Once you verify the account, you can login to Code Step By Step. (The verification email may end up in your Spam folder, so make sure to look there too.) |br|

Part 2: Sign up for your course
