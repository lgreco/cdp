Computer Equipment
------------------

You will need access to a desktop or laptop computer with a simple text editor and a Java compiler. An Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) is a superb tool and   and `IntelliJ IDEA <https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/>`_, is the IDE of choice for this course. You may also request a virtual machine that comes with all the necessary tools and that you may access from any web browser, anywhere in the world.
