COMP 180 Data Analysis for the Sciences
=======================================

COMP 180 serves two purposes: one is to introduce you to simple programming, using *Python*. The other is to show you how you can process and manage data (using Python, of course). Data processing and data management require some mathemagical skills. Any college-level course in algebra or calculus is sufficient background. The course has three parts: 

* Introduction to programming with Python, using interactive Python notebooks. If you have taken an introductory programming course before, this part may appear redundant. However, it will be worth your time as we'll explore the comforts and and features of interactive Python notebooks, and discuss some practical topics in programming. Expect 3-4 weeks.

* Managing and processing numerical (mostly) data. Computing was (and is) about manipulating numbers. Where do these numbers come from? How we obtain them? How we represent them? How we turn them into information, insight, and knowledge? Expect 6-7 weeks.

* Working with text data. There is so much content published on the web. Can we plow through it? Can we find reliable information? Can we tell fake news from facts? These questions can be answered with text analysis that is often considered a gateway to artificial intelligence and machine learning. Expect 4-5 weeks.

Weekly plan
+++++++++++

Each class (ie ensemble of students and instructor) develops its own pacing. In general, however, the following weekly schedule is a good guideline for the course. We may deviate from it as needed. Guidelines tend to be ambitious; as long as we cover 80% of the topics below, we can be proud of ourselves. The numbers below correspond of the week of the term.


#. Introductions, course expectations, ground rules, tools, the concept of computer program.
#. Our first Python program. Basic syntax rules. Simple commands (print, input). Simple variables and simple numeric operations. Lists, strings, and related operations.
#. Flow control (loops, if-blocks).
#. Dependencies, user defined functions.

#. Extended numerical operations and the ``numpy`` library. Data summarization using dataframes in ``pandas``.
#. Solving realistic problems with ``numpy`` and ``pandas``.
#. Simulation v. acquisition of data. Descriptive analytics.
#. Collecting and curating data from online sources. The ETL process.
#. The need to visualize data. Taxonomy of visualization.
#. Exploring ``matplotlib`` with realistic data sets. Interactive visuals.

#. Improving our chances at ``wordle``. The mathematics of guessing faster, better.
#. Parsing and visualizing text using basic stemming and lemmatization.
#. Reconstructing texts from partial information.
#. Summarizing and producing text.


Textbook
++++++++
There is no required textbook for this course. Reading material will be posted online as needed.

Computer Equipment
++++++++++++++++++
You will also need access to a computer (laptop or desktop) with a web browser. No other software is required for the course. We will use a web-based programming environment hosted by Google. To access this environment, called Google Colaboratory, you'll need a Google account. If you do not have one already, you can sign up for one (it's free).  

Grading scheme
++++++++++++++

Course performance is determined using homework, a take-home midterm, and a take-home final. Each assessment component carries a 33.33% weight. There will be about 10 homework assignments. Grading scheme aside, the objective of assessments in this course is to ensure **that students are learning.** In this context students make mistakes, understand them, and do not repeat them.

For courses with asynchronous components, the assessments above are worth 30% each; engangement with asynchronous material (watching videos, completing the in-video quizzes, etc) carries a weight of 10%.
