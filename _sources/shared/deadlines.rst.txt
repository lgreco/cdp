Deadlines
=========

Deadlines are posted on the cource's Sakai page. In general, late homework is not accepted. *Bona fide* emergencies are handled on a case-by-case basis. However, if you miss three or more assignment deadlines, you may find it difficult to finish the course with a qualifying grade.
