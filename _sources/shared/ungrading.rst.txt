Ungrading and how it works
============================

*Ungrading* is a low-stress approach to evaluating progress through a course. 

We are accustomed to the traditional method of grading, where assignments are returned with a numeric score or letter grade, but the feedback may not be sufficient to understand areas of improvement. Additionally, we are penalized for our mistakes, despite the fact that they are an essential part of the learning process.

*Ungrading* emphasizes on feedback that is aimed at helping students improve. Each assignment is viewed as a learning opportunity, where students can reflect on what they did well, and what needs to be improved. Feedback received helps students identify areas of strength and areas that require more work. Progress is tracked by evaluating how well the feedback has been incorporated into the work, and this progress is used to determine a course grade that the student feels they have earned.

The final course grade is ultimately the responsibility of the instructor, however, students are expected to provide their own self-evaluation by proposing their own grade. This is done by writing a brief reflection statement at midterm and near the end of the term, taking into account the feedback received and the extent to which it was incorporated into the work. Based on their own assessment, students will propose a letter grade (A, B, C, or D). This proposal will be considered by the instructor when determining the final course grade.

An effective way to show that feedback has been taken into account is by avoiding recurring issues. These issues can be technical or non-technical in nature. Technical issues are easily recognizable such as writing methods with multiple returns and being asked to reduce them to a single return statement. If the student continues to make the same mistakes, it suggests that the feedback was not effectively incorporated. If there is a valid reason for disregarding feedback, it should be discussed with the instructor.


In general, technical issues are based on requirements, specifications, etc. Soft issues may be more challenging: skipping assignment, turning assignments late, not attending class meetings, not reaching out for assistance, etc. 

As a teacher, I have found that most students have a good understanding of their own performance in a course. *Ungrading* allows me to collaborate with students in articulating their sense of learning, recognizing the skills they have developed, and identifying areas that require more focus and effort to improve.


Reflection statements
-----------------------


For the midterm and end-of-term reflections statements, I use `Jesse Stommel's suggestions <https://www.jessestommel.com/ungrading-an-faq/>`__ with some additional questions.

Midterm reflection
-----------------------

* What aspects of the course have been the most successful for you so far? 
* What thing that you've learned are you most excited about?
* What challenges have you encountered? 
* Can you suggest one or two areas that it may be worth focusing/improving?
* Based on your performance so far, what do you feel your course grade should be? Choose from A, B, C, or D.

End-of-term reflection
-----------------------

* Write me a short letter that reflects on your work in this class. 
* Consider the work you did on exams, assignments, and lab/studio sessions, the feedback you gave and received, and how you met your own goals. 
* Feel free to include examples of your work as necessary. 
* Did you miss any significant work? 
* Is there anything you are particularly proud of?
* If, in the midterm reflection, you identified any areas for improvement/focus, how did you do?
* What letter grade would you give yourself in this course? Choose from A, B, C, or D. (Ideally, I would give everyone the grade they give themselves, but I reserve the right to raise or lower grades as appropriate. Also notice that the grade you propose (A,B,C,D) is a range. The actual grade may vary slightly. For example, you may propose a B but end up with an A-. Or you may propose a B and earn a B-.)


Frequently Asked Questions about *Ungrading*
----------------------------------------------


**What is the grade I see in Sakai?** Everytime you submit an assignment, you will earn 1 point. This is not the score of the assignment. This is just Sakai's way of keeping track who submitted an assignment. Whether your assignment is spot on or off the mark, you will earn 1 point for submitting it. These points do not translate to a score that determines a course grade.

**Is there a grade scale?** Yes. Students that do not repeat mistakes, usually finish with an A or an A-. Students that require 1-2 reminders for the same mistakes may end the course with a grade in the B range. Students that require more frequent feedback for repeating mistakes but do finally move on, will end the course with a grade in the C range. Students that do not incorporate the feedback will probably finish the course with a D. Rarely, a student may finish the course with an F. I try to avoid this grade; if I feel that you are heading towards an F, I'll reach out to you to discuss improvement or alternative plans.

**Will there be make-up assignments?** Every assignment is a make-up assignment: an opportunity to improve on issues that were identified in previous assignments. There will be no extra assignments, however.


**I still see homework grades in Sakai, what's up with this?** These are not really grades. You get 1 point in Sakai for each assignment you submit. That's really a counter of how many assignments you turned in, not actual evaluative score.

**Why?**  *Ungrading* is very similar to a job situation. We receive feedback from peers and supervisors. The feedback tells us what we do well and what needs more attention. We use the feedback to meet new challenges, improve our skills, and advance our careers. *Ungrading* is also less stressful because you do not have to worry about a grade scale. It allows you to focus on learning and it is forgiving with mistakes that are not repeated.)
