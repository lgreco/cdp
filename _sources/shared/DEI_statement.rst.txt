It is my hope and goal to make this course one of your best learning experiences. Computer science courses can sometimes be a bit dry, with little room for variety in perspectives. Nevertheless, there will be opportunities to explore social and cultural aspects of the discipline. The course also offers the opportunity to learn from each other about how we process advanced technical and mathematical concepts. Understanding how different individuals conceptualize and internalize practical and foundational aspects of computing makes us better professionals and colleagues. By respecting the different perspectives, experiences, and worldviews represented in our classroom community, we make the course a space of learning and growth.

As an instructor, I am committed to continue improving this space of learning and growth. This is not something I can do alone. Your feedback and suggestions are essential and wholeheartedly welcome at any time.
