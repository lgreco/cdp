Academic integrity
==================


Students are expected and encouraged to work together. It is also expected that students will explore the vastness of the internet to discover information, knowledge, and solutions to problems. I consider all that to be part of your learning experience. It is up to you, however, to demonstrate your learning. 

In practical terms this means that you should be able to describe in your own words how a piece of code works or how you arrived to a mathematical derivation, etc. Failure to do so will affect your course performance and, ultimately, your grade. It may also raise concerns related to academic integrity. *Verbatim* use of material obtained from others is considered a violation of the university's policies for academic integrity.

Please note that if you can search for an answer on the internet, so can your instructor. When it comes to programming, there are several websites with good code examples. These are `geeksforgeeks <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/>`__, `stackoverflow <https://stackoverflow.com/>`__, etc. You are expected to explore these sites. The code you find there can be extremely useful. **It is up to you to turn these websites into a learning experience.** How? By internalizing the code that you discover in these sites and adopt for your assignments. 

If you employ an AI tool, cite its use and list the prompts you used to derive your work. Work that has been found to be produced by generative AI without citation and listing of prompts, will receive a 0 grade.

Computing, i.e., programming and its foundational topics such as mathematics, is something that is best learned by example. But copying other people's work alone is not sufficient. We must internalize that work, i.e., we must understand how someone else's code works, how it does it, and why. Without that internalization, we simply copy someone else's work. And that is not sufficient to pass a course.
